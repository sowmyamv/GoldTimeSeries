# 🪙 Gold Price Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis (ARIMA & SARIMA)

This project performs in-depth **time series analysis** and **forecasting** on monthly gold prices using **ARIMA** and **SARIMA** models. It also features a full-fledged **Streamlit app** for interactive exploration, model selection, and dynamic forecasting.

---

## 📦 Project Features

### ✅ Time Series Workflow Includes:
- Downloading gold price data from **Yahoo Finance**
- **Visualization** of trends over time
- **STL decomposition** to separate trend, seasonality, and noise
- **ADF test** for stationarity
- **Differencing** to make the series stationary
- **ACF and PACF plots** to determine model orders
- **Model building** with ARIMA and SARIMA
- **Forecasting** next 12 months
- **Model comparison** using AIC/BIC
- **Model saving** using pickle

### ✅ Interactive Streamlit Web App:
- Choose between ARIMA and SARIMA models
- Forecast up to 36 months into the future
- Visualize forecast with **confidence intervals**
- View model summary and raw historical data

## 🧠 Model Details

| Model  | AIC / BIC | Seasonality | Stationarity | Forecast Horizon |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| ARIMA  | Evaluated | ❌ No        | Differenced  | Short-term       |
| SARIMA | Evaluated | ✅ Yes       | Differenced  | Seasonal-aware   |

### 🔬 ACF & PACF Interpretation Tips:

* ACF with spikes at seasonal lags → Add seasonal terms
* PACF cut-off after lag `p` → Suggests AR model order
* ACF cut-off after lag `q` → Suggests MA model order

## 🧪 ADF Test Result Sample Output

```
ADF Statistic: -1.56
p-value: 0.51
Conclusion: Time series is **non-stationary**. Differencing is required.
```
